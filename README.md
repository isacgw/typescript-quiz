A simple quiz built with ReactJS and Typescript.

[Live demo](https://typescript-quiz-psi.vercel.app/)

### Why did I make this project?

Basically I just wanted to get an introduction to Typescript, that was the main goal. I know it's becoming more and more popular
within the industry and I wanted to see what it's all about and what you can do with it. 

___

### What technologies did I use?

* Typescript
* ReactJS
* Styled Components

___

### What did I learn?

I was introduced to Typescript and while I still haven't even mastered Javascript I feel like I at least understand the
concept of Typescript and why you can benefit from using it in projects. Also got to practice some logic with writing the functions
for the questions which is always something you can't get enough of. Got some repitition with using an open API to fetch data, and using
styled components again.

___

### Future improvments?

I'd probably start something new from scratch if I'm being honest since this was mostly for practice but I'd implement
a database where you can save your score and compare yourself to others. Something I would also add is the ability to select
different question categories so if you want to do sports question you can do that, or if you want music questions you can do that etc. 
Since this API actually allows that, just need to work with different endpoints.
